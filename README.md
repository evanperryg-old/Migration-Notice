# Migration-Notice
I have migrated my work to two new places:

## [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ryukoposting)

Some highlights:
- [`lastfm-nim`](https://gitlab.com/ryukoposting/lastfm-nim): last.fm API bindings for Nim.
- [`Cheatle`](https://gitlab.com/ryukoposting/cheatle): a surprisingly sophisticated Wordle cheater tool, made in Svelte. See it live at [cheatle.evangrove.com](https://cheatle.evangrove.com)
- My tweaked version of [`plan9port`](https://gitlab.com/ryukoposting/plan9port) which adds auto-indentation and tabs-as-spaces features to the Sam text editor.
- [`croutines`](https://gitlab.com/ryukoposting/croutines) a stupid-simple (and not very performant) coroutines library for C.

## [Github](https://github.com/ryukoposting)

Some highlights:
- [`ruby-nim`](https://github.com/ryukoposting/ruby-nim) expressive framework for embedding the Ruby interpreter inside Nim programs.
